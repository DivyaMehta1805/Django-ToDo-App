# Django-ToDo-App
This is a To-Do app build using django framework of python. Here user can create his todo list by adding items, crossed off the completed items, delete the completed items and can delete all the items.

Technologies Used : 

    1. Python
    2. Django
    3. Bootstrap
    4. JavaScript
    
Additional Python Modules Required:

    1.Django
    
Running the project:

1. Migrate :

       > cd todo_app
       > python manage.py migrate
    
2. Make Admin User :

       > python manage.py createsuperuser
    
3. runserver :

       > cd todo_app 
       > python manage.py runserver  
Detailed Description of Changes Made By Divya Mehta:
##Tasks Completed Per Day - Overview
-This feature of the ToDo application provides a visual representation of tasks completed versus tasks not completed over the past 30 days.
-It leverages Chart.js to render a bar chart, showing counts of tasks per day.
-The data is fetched from a backend API endpoint that aggregates tasks based on their completion status.

##Architecture and Functionality
 #View Functions (views.py)
  -tasks_graph(request):
  -This view renders the tasks_graph.html template.
  -It calls the tasks_per_day_view function to prepare the data required for the chart but doesn't pass the data directly to the template; it relies on the frontend to fetch it via an API 
   call.
 #tasks_per_day_view(request):
  -This view is responsible for aggregating and providing the task data in JSON format.
  -It calculates task counts for completed and not completed tasks over the past 30 days.
  -Constructs a dictionary with dates as keys and counts as values.
  -Combines and formats the dates and counts into a JSON response.
#Template (tasks_graph.html)
  -HTML Structure:
  -The template includes a <canvas> element where the Chart.js graph will be rendered.
  -It links to a CSS file for basic styling and includes the Chart.js library for rendering charts.
#JavaScript Functionality:
  -Fetches JSON data from the /tasks_per_day_view/ endpoint.
  -Parses the JSON response to extract dates and counts of completed and not completed tasks.
  -Uses Chart.js to render a bar chart with:
  -X-axis: Dates.
  -Y-axis: Count of tasks.
  -Two datasets: One for completed tasks and one for not completed tasks.
  -Configures the chart with labels and styling for the data series.
  -URLs Configuration (urls.py)

 URL Patterns:
  -path('tasks_per_day_view/', views.tasks_per_day_view, name='tasks_per_day_view'): Endpoint for fetching task data in JSON format.
  -This URL is used by the frontend JavaScript to retrieve the necessary data for rendering the chart.
 Model (models.py)
  at Field:
  -The at field in the Todo model is a DateTimeField that records when a task was created or updated.
  -It is used in the aggregation queries to filter tasks based on their date of creation or completion.
  -Data Flow and Connectivity
  -User Interaction:
        When the user navigates to the tasks_graph page, the tasks_graph.html template is rendered, which includes a Chart.js graph.
#Data Fetching:
  -The frontend JavaScript makes an HTTP GET request to the /tasks_per_day_view/ endpoint.
  -The tasks_per_day_view view processes this request, aggregates the task data, and returns it as a JSON response.
#Chart Rendering:
  -The JavaScript on the tasks_graph.html page processes the JSON response.
  -It uses Chart.js to plot the data on a bar chart, displaying completed versus not completed tasks for each day over the last 30 days.
#Search Functionality
-The search functionality is embedded in the index.html template and interacts with the taskList view:
-Users enter a search query into the input field provided in the search form.
-Submitting the form triggers a GET request to the taskList URL with the search query as a parameter.
-The taskList view processes this query and filters the tasks accordingly.
-The filtered list of tasks is then rendered back to the user on the index.html page, showing only those tasks that match the search criteria.
#Views (views.py)
-taskList(request):
-This view handles the display and search functionality for tasks.
-It initializes the TaskSearchForm with the GET request parameters.
-Retrieves all tasks from the database.
-Filters tasks based on the search query (query), if provided.
-Passes the filtered tasks and the form to the taskList.html template for rendering.
#Forms (forms.py)
TaskSearchForm:
A form used to capture the search query from the user.
The form includes a single optional field (query) for searching tasks.
It uses a TextInput widget with a class of form-control and a placeholder to enhance user experience.
#Templates
 #task_list.html:
   -Displays the list of tasks with their details including the completion status.
   -Uses a loop to iterate over todo_list and renders each task's text, description, and completion status.
   -Provides a message when no tasks are found.
 #index.html:
   -Includes a search form that posts to the taskList view.
